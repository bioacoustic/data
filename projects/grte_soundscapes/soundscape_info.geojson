This area is directly under the flight path of aircraft approaching the Jackson Hole Airport from the north, but the sounds from road vehicles on Highway 89 are heard more frequently.",

The summit of Grand Teton is usually very quiet except for when the wind picks up or there are climbers talking. Most of the motor sounds are fairly quiet because of their distance. Aircraft are much louder than road vehicles, especially if they are flying nearby. Only a few hearty birds frequent the high peaks, most of which are Common Ravens. Small rodents are present, but active mostly at night.  ",
