The summit of Grand Teton is usually very quiet except for when the wind picks up or there are climbers talking. Most of the motor sounds are fairly quiet because of their distance and therefore are hard to identify. Aircraft are much louder than road vehicles, especially if they are flying nearby. Only a few hearty birds frequent the high peaks, most frequent of which are Common Ravens. Small rodents are present and their faint gnawing can be heard, but mostly at night. ",
